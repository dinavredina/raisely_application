            <ul>
              <li>I admire the way you found how to help others through 
                the technology and would like to be a part of your team.</li>
              <li>During my university years I’ve participated in a couple of 
                  volunteer projects and it would be great 
                  if I could dedicate my full-time job to bring a positive social impact.</li>
              <li>Since you’re a fully remote company, I believe the work process and organization will 
                  be superb. I can cope with chaos but believe in proper procedures.</li>

          <p class="lead">Platform that solved a complex problem</p>
          <p>To my mind Uber solved a problem of safe and affordable 
            transportation either you’re travelling in your home town or being 
            abroad. You can always check the rating of a driver and follow your 
            drive on the map in real time. <br>But sometimes the suggested route is not optimal 
            and it would be great if I could approve the route in 
            advance or make my personal suggestions online.</p>
